    transcript: `Agent: Hi Marcus, thanks for calling in. What brings you in today?
Patient: I've had this tightness in my chest since yesterday afternoon, and I'm getting short of breath walking up stairs.
Agent: I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the chest tightness — is it a pressure, a sharp pain, or something else?
Patient: It's more like pressure, kind of a squeezing feeling, right in the center of my chest.
Agent: Does it radiate anywhere, like to your arm, jaw, or back?
Patient: Yeah, actually, a little into my left arm now that you mention it.
Agent: Have you had any sweating, nausea, or dizziness along with this?
Patient: I broke into a cold sweat this morning and felt a little lightheaded.
Agent: Any history of heart problems, high blood pressure, or high cholesterol?
Patient: I have high blood pressure, been on lisinopril for about five years. My dad had a heart attack at 60.
Agent: Are you currently taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed?
Patient: Yes, every morning.
Agent: On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate the chest tightness right now?
Patient: Right now maybe a 6, but it spiked to an 8 a couple hours ago.
Agent: Have you taken any aspirin or nitroglycerin?
Patient: No, I don't have any nitroglycerin. I haven't taken anything.
Agent: Are you experiencing any shortness of breath right now, even at rest?
Patient: A little, yeah, it's hard to take a full deep breath.
Agent: Given what you're describing — chest pressure radiating to your arm, sweating, shortness of breath, and a family history of heart disease — this needs urgent in-person evaluation right away, not a routine visit. Have you considered calling 911 or going to the ER?
Patient: I was hoping to avoid that but I understand if that's what's needed.
Agent: I strongly recommend you or someone with you call 911 now or go directly to the nearest emergency room. I'm flagging this for immediate provider review.
Patient: Okay, my wife can drive me, we'll head to the ER now.
Agent: Please do that immediately. I'm documenting everything you've told me for the provider and the ER team.`,

    medications: [{ name: 'Cetirizine (Zyrtec)', dosage: '10mg as needed for allergies' }],
    transcript: `Agent: Hi Priya, welcome in. What's the reason for today's visit?
Patient: Just my annual physical, keeping up with my yearly checkup.
Agent: Great, any specific concerns you want to bring up while we're at it?
Patient: My seasonal allergies have been a bit worse this spring, some sneezing and itchy eyes, but nothing major.
Agent: How long has that been going on?
Patient: About three weeks, pretty typical for this time of year for me.
Agent: Are you taking anything for it?
Patient: Just over-the-counter Zyrtec when it gets bad, maybe twice a week.
Agent: Any other medications or supplements you're currently taking?
Patient: Just a daily multivitamin.
Agent: Any changes in weight, appetite, sleep, or energy levels since your last visit?
Patient: No, everything's been pretty stable. I've actually been sleeping better since I started exercising more.
Agent: That's great to hear. Any chest pain, shortness of breath, or heart palpitations?
Patient: No, none of that.
Agent: Any digestive issues, headaches, or other new symptoms?
Patient: Nope, feeling pretty good overall.
Agent: Do you have any known allergies to medications?
Patient: No known drug allergies.
Agent: Family history of any major conditions we should note?
Patient: My mom has type 2 diabetes, and my grandfather had high blood pressure.
Agent: Good to know, we'll keep that in mind for preventive screening. Are you due for any vaccinations, like a flu shot or Tdap booster?
Patient: I think my Tdap might be due soon, not sure exactly when I got my last one.
Agent: We'll check that during the visit and update as needed. Anything else on your mind before we wrap up?
Patient: No, I think that covers it. Thanks!
Agent: Perfect, this all sounds routine and low risk. We'll get your vitals and labs done at the visit.`,
